# Potato-disease-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. We will use image classification using CNN and built a model using which a farmer can take a picture and app will tell you if the plant has a disease or not. Technology stack for this project will be,
**Model Building**: tensorflow, CNN, data augmentation, tf dataset
**Backend Server and ML Ops**: tf serving, FastAPI
